The Goal: 
Be the first player to cross the finish line at the end of a 2000m race by carefully managing your stamina and stroke rate.


Game Setup:
➤ The course: 
	The race takes place on a straight venue with 6 parallel lanes (one boat per lane) with a distance of 2000m. The course is divided into 100 spaces, where 1 space equals 20m.

➤ Course Sectors: 
	The course is divided into four 500m sectors, and in each sector there is a split line at the 500m, 1000m and 1500m. Each Split Lines represents a Physiological Threshold that limits how much wherePace a boat can generate when pacing through this zones. The last 250m of the race also have a Split Line

➤ The deck: 
	Each player chooses a color and gets an assigned lane, if the total number of player doesn't reach 6, the remaining boat will be NPCs.
	
	- Pace Cards (12): Movement cards worth 1, 2 and 3 spaces
	
	- Instability Cards (3): These cards represent unstable rowing under fatigue. When played, the top card of your draw deck is flipped and its value is added to your Pace.
	
	- Stamina Cards (6): Begin in a separate Stamina Pile, entering your into the Discard Pile during the race

➤ Other Components:
	- Draw Deck: Deck with Pace and Instability cards that you use to replenish your hand
	- Discard Pile: Pile with played and discarded cards
	- Starting Stock Rate: You start the race with a stroke rate of 45 spm.
	- Starting Hand: Draw 7 cards from your draw deck


Round Structure:
The game is played over several rounds until all boats finish the race. 
Each round, every player completes the following steps in order:
1. Change or maintain Stroke rate.
2. Play cards,
3. Advance boat.
4. Replenish Hand.


Stroke Rate:
At the start of your turn, choose whether to keep or change your Stroke Rate. 
Stroke Rate determines how many cards you must play and any additional effects.

	Stroke Rates:
	35 spm:
	- Cards played: 1 Pace card
	- Effect: Cooldown – Move up to 2 Stamina Cards from your hand back to the Stamina Pile
	
	40 spm:
	- Cards played: 2 Pace cards
	- Effect: No effect
	
	45 spm:
	- Cards played: 4 Pace cards
	- Effect: Strain – Move 1 Stamina Card from the Stamina Pile into the Discard Pile. This effect doesn't occur in the first turn of the game

	Changing Stroke Rate:
	- You may increase or decrease your Stroke Rate by one step freely.
	- You may jump directly from one extreme to the other (35 to 45 spm or 45 to 35 spm).
	- Jumping costs 1 Stamina Card moved from the Stamina Pile into the Discard Pile.


Set Pace and Move:
You must play exactly the number of cards required by your current Stroke Rate.
Note: Stamina Cards can't be played.

	Determining Pace:
	- Add the space values from all played cards.
	- for each Instability Cards: The top card of the draw deck is flipped and add to your pace.

	Movement:
	- The boat moves the forward the number of spaces equal to the determined pace.
	- After crossing the finish line you may not move the boat.


Physiological Threshold (Pace Limit):
Whenever your movement crosses a Split Line, you must now check your pace.

	Pace Limits:
	- 500m:		Pace Limit: 4
	- 1000m:	Pace Limit: 5
	- 1500m:	Pace Limit: 6
	- 1750m:	Pace Limit: 8

	Exceeding the Pace Limit
	- If your Pace exceeds the Pace Limit, you must pay Stamina Cards equal to the difference from the Stamina Pile into the Discard Pile.
	- If you can’t pay the full cost because the Stamina Pile is or becomes empty, you immediately catch a crab.

	Catch a crab
	When you catch a crab:
	1. Move your boat back to the space immediately before the Split Line that caused it.
	2. Take Stamina Cards from the Stamina Pile into your Discard Pile based on the Stroke Rate:
		- 35 spm: 1 Stamina Cards 
		- 40 spm: 2 Stamina Cards
		- 45 spm: 3 Stamina Cards
	3. Reset your Stroke Rate to 35 spm.


Replenish Hand:
Perform the following steps in order:
1. You may discard any number of Pace Cards from your hand into the Discard Pile. (Note: You may never discard Instability or Stamina cards.)
2. All cards played cards are placed into your Discard Pile.
3. If your Stroke Rate is at 35 spm, move up to 2 Stamina cards from your hand back to the Stamina Pile
4. Draw cards until you have 7 cards in your hand


Change of tides:
If you are in one of the last two positions at the end of the round, you may move 1 additional Space. 

You caught a change in the river, maybe the current or the wind become more favourable to you, augmenting the speed of your boat, catch them!


Motivation:
If you end your move adjacent to or behind another boat, you may spend 1 Stamina Card from the Stamina pile into the Discard Pile to move 2 additional spaces forward.

- Motivation may not be used to cross the finish line.
- Motivation may not be used after you have finished the race.

Put your hands on the fire and pass them!


Out of cards:
At any point, if you must draw, flip, or discard cards and your draw deck is empty:
- Shuffle the Discard Pile to form a new draw deck. 
- Then resolve the remaining effect.

Played cards in this turn are not shuffled until discarded.


Stamina Cards:
As you row through the race you will accumulate Stamina Cards in your Discard Pile, ending up in your hand. 
- Stamina Cards accumulate in your hand reducing your effective hand size.
- They can never be played or discarded.
- The only way to remove them is by rowing at 35 spm.
- Stamina cards cycle between the Stamina Pile and your hand throughout the race.
	

Cluttered Hand:
If you do not have enough playable cards to meet your Stroke Rate requirement:

1. Play as many valid cards as possible.
2. Cover the remaining required cards with Stamina cards.
3. Your boat does not move this turn.
4. Immediately:
   - Set your Stroke Rate to 35 spm
   - Discard all cards from your Play Area
   - Skip directly to Replenish Hand


How to Win:
You win the race by being the first player to cross the finish line. The game continues until all the boats finish the race.

	Tiebreakers:
	If two or more boats finish in the same round:
	1. The player that would be in the front after moving remaining spaces  
	2. If still tied, the player with the biggest Stroke Rate wins.
